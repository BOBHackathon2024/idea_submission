### Overview:

1. Our project leverages generative AI to create personalized marketing content for banking customers, enhancing their engagement and experience.
2. It processes client metadata, account summaries, and activity logs stored in Azure Cosmos DB to gather Personalized Prior Information (PPI). 
3. This PPI is used in a LlamaIndex agent pipeline with Azure OpenAI-GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate Personalized Retrieved Information (PRI).  
4. PPI and PRI are combined to produce interactive marketing content, including text summaries, images, and short videos, delivered through multiple channels with multilingual support.
5. A chatbot assistant offers personalized help in users' native languages and improves PPIs based on chat history analysis.
6. Collaborative filtering recommends items to clients based on similar users' interests, reducing content generation overhead.
